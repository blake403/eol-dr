# EOL DR / End-of-life Disaster Response

This document was originally created on 8/12/2025 and is meant to document and track my homelab, and related services.

# checklist.md -> checklist.docx

Within hours of this interaction, I created a Word document, printed it out, filled in a couple passwords manually, and then stored it in a fire proof bag.

Here is a sanitized list that you can use for your own purposes. If anything is missing or you have suggestions, please feel free to submit a PR. Upon approval, the Word doc will be regenerated for others.

So here is the checklist:

* In markdown format: [checklist.md](/checklist.md)
* In docx format, generated by the GitHub Action: [checklist.docx](/checklist.docx)
